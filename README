This is Neko Project II Wii (np2wii).
It is based off of Neko Project II v0.81a, by YUI (http://www.yui.ne.jp/np2/)
The goal of this project is to fully port Neko Project II to the Nintendo Wii console.
It will have all the features that the original had. It will also have a nice Graphical User Interface.
