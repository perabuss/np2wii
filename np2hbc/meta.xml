	<long_description>Neko Project II Wii is a port of Neko Project II. Neko Project II was originally written by YUI.

This is a very early version, and is the bare minimum needed to play a game. When you start NP2Wii, you will be presented with a dialog to load disks. Press B to continue past this dialog.

The Wiimote mapping is very simple, and is available on WiiBrew (or the source code file taskmng.c)

There is 1 file that is required by Neko Project II Wii. This is the font.bmp file. It must be placed in SD:/PC98/DATA/ as font.bmp. Floppy and Hard Disk images must be stored in SD:/PC98/ROMS/
